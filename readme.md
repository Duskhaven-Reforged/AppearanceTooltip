### AppearanceTooltip

AppearanceTooltip shows you the appearance of items in your inventory. It does this by attaching a Model frame to the item tooltip, showing your character wearing the item.

This addon was retroported to WoW 3.3.5 by ReynoldsCahoon with assistance and moral support from retset of the WoW Modding Community.
